### TSA Complaints Analysis 
#### Synopsis: 
This project analyzes TSA complaint data from 2015 to 2021, focusing on patterns and trends across U.S. airports. The primary audience for this analysis includes TSA regional operations managers and analysts, who will benefit from actionable insights presented with clarity and sufficient depth for decision-making.


The purpose is to uncover patterns in TSA complaints by type, subcategory, and over time. The analysis reveals that "Expedited Passenger Screening Program," "mishandling of property," and "Customer Service" are consistently dominant complaint categories. Within these, subcategories like '*' (unknown) and 'TSO' are frequently reported. Monthly trends indicate a significant decrease in complaints during the COVID-19 pandemic. Spatial analysis shows that while high complaint volumes often correlate with passenger traffic at major airports, some smaller airports exhibit disproportionately high issues.
